I only do Drupal related projects.

My one man company is registered in Italy. I invoice my services. I do however accept payrolling if required.

Having an EU passport and company, I can be employed freelance in any member state without hassle.

For the US, Canada and Australia I am tied to the visa regulations. I can come over for a period of 90 days and be compensated for expenses only. I am available remote and open for proposals.


## On location

I have a daily all-in rate when working on location that does include accommodation and travel expenses. To cover for those, a probationary period of one month should be respected.

I can arrange initial accommodation myself through [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/7889468).


## 100 % remote

Work done from my office has a more convenient rate.

It might be good to know I:

- am more productive in my own place
- have a dedicated office
- have no kids around
- adapt to your time zone when necessary.

When working remote I ask for:

- the availability of technical specifications
- the use of an issue tracker
- a central repository to push, Git or FTP
- appointment of a contact person, usually the PM
- a minimum of weekly conference meetings (VOIP).


## A combination

Sometimes it is required to remain available for maintenance work after project delivery. In that case we can start full-time on location and continue part-time remote.


## Training

Training programs are custom made company in-house. The normal daily rate applies plus expenses. It takes two days of preparation for each training day plus an additional two days for travelling.

Preliminary download/install instructions and training material are made available to participants prior to the course.


## My daily rate

Ask me. You will likely be positively surprised.
